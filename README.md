# Wine Quality Prediction

## Overview
This project uses Lasso regression for feature selection and Polynomial Regression to predict wine quality. It is implemented in Python using `scikit-learn` and `pandas` in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Steps
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Use Lasso regression to select important features.
3. Apply Polynomial Regression to the selected features.
4. Train and evaluate the model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
  ```

## Running the Notebook
Open Jupyter Notebook and run the script step by step:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
